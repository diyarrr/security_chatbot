# Rank-Aware Security Advisor Chatbot

## üìñ Project Description

This project is an AI-powered Security Advisor Chatbot designed to interactively educate users on cybersecurity best practices. It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, context-aware advice. The chatbot features a gamified progression system where users gain Experience Points (XP) and advance through ranks, unlocking access to more advanced security topics.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can ask security-related questions in natural language.
- **Rank-Based Progression:** A system of ranks and XP (from "Security Novice" to "Security Master") to motivate learning.
- **Topic Gating:** Access to advanced topics is restricted by the user's rank, ensuring a structured learning path.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The chatbot uses a knowledge base built from your own PDF documents to provide accurate and reliable answers, reducing hallucinations.
- **PDF Document Processing:** Automatically processes your own security documents (e.g., company policies, NIST guidelines) to build the chatbot's knowledge base.
- **Interactive Quizzes:** The chatbot generates follow-up questions to test user understanding and award XP for correct answers.
