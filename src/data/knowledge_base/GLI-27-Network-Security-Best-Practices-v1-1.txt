ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT 
This network security best practices resource has been produced by Gaming Laboratories 
International, LLC for the purpose of providing a “best practices” document specific to 
Network Security.  Therefore, it is intended that this document be utilized as a reference for 
Network Security and not be viewed as a direct regulatory standard. 
Network Security is a complex subject matter and varies widely as a function of the specific 
network and the type of data that is carried by that network.  Additionally, the scale of the 
network often directly impacts the level and types of security measures implemented.  For these 
reasons, the recommendations and guidance contained within this document should not be 
interpreted as being applicable to every network, as any one security element may or may not be 
suitable.  Each network must be evaluated based on a number of factors such as those mentioned 
above, and then an appropriate plan developed for implementation.  This document provides 
some level of guidance in terms of what best practices exist presently and how they might be 
applied to a given network.  The information presented should therefore be viewed as offering 
considerations not requirements. 
This Network Security best practices document is targeted to gaming regulatory agencies, 
gaming operators, and industry suppliers as a helpful reference for implementing network 
security measures.  The document is in response to gaming industry stakeholders who have 
requested technical guidance in the network security space.  It is not intended to represent a set 
of hard standards that every supplier and every network must comply with, as one size does not 
fit all in the network security space. 
GLI-27 must be viewed as a living document which is expected to change as technology and 
network security practices evolve. 
GLI-27 is not intended to replace or negate any current or future document in the GLI Standard 
Series.  As just one example, the recommendations in GLI-27 are not intended to circumvent any 
specifications in GLI-21 should the network in question support Client Server functionality.  
Likewise for other types of networks and the GLI standards document that specifically applies to 
those networks.

CHAPTER 1 
1.0 STANDARD OVERVIEW 
 
1.1 
Introduction 
 
1.1.1 General Statement. Gaming Laboratories International, LLC (GLI) has been testing 
gaming equipment since 1989. Over the years, we have developed numerous standards for 
jurisdictions all over the world. GLI has chosen to create this document as a best practices 
resource for gaming regulatory agencies and gaming operators as a reference for implementing 
network security measures. In recent years, many gaming industry stakeholders have opted to 
ask for technical guidance in the network security space. In addition, network security 
technology is inherently complex so GLI realized the need to create a reference in a format 
familiar to the industry which can assist in building their knowledge of network security 
disciplines. This document, GLI Standard 27, will set forth the Best Practices in Network 
Security. 
 
1.1.2 Document History. This document is based upon industry examples of network security, 
and principally technical standards adopted by the State of Arizona as well as common 
requirements extracted from applicable standards defined by NIST and ISO. We have taken each 
of the standards’ documents, merged each of the unique rules together, eliminating some rules 
and updating others, in order to reflect both the change in technology and the purpose of 
maintaining an objective, factual reference. We have listed below, and given credit to, agencies 
whose documents we reviewed prior to writing this best practices resource. It is the policy of 
Gaming Laboratories International, LLC to update this document as often as possible to 
reflect changes in technology, testing methods, or cheating methods. This document will be 
distributed FREE OF CHARGE to all those who request it.  This reference and all others may be 
obtained by downloading it from our website at www.gaminglabs.com or by writing to us at:

the best practices, while at the same time, to encourage new methods to be developed. 
1.3.2 No Limitation of Technology. One should be cautioned that this document should not be 
read in such a way that limits the use of future technology. The document should not be 
interpreted that if the technology is not mentioned, then it is not allowed. Quite to the contrary, 
as new technology is developed, we will review this best practices reference, make changes and 
incorporate accommodations for the new technology. 
 
1.4 
Principles of Secure Network Design 
1.4.1 Network Security Design Principles. Prior to implementing a network security solution, 
several key principles must be considered. Some of these principles include:  
a) 
Integrity means that the security measures must be preservative. They must not corrupt 
data. They must not lose data. They must protect the data in a consistent way at all times. 
They must protect confidentiality and sensitivity of data.  
b) 
Availability means that the security measures must be available at all times and that the 
systems and data they are protecting must be available at all times.  
c) 
Adequate protection means that what you are protecting must be protected to a degree 
commensurate with their value. Computer items must be protected only until they lose 
their value and they must be protected to a degree consistent with their value.  
d) 
Effectiveness means that any controls that are implemented must be effective in securing 
the network and its component parts. However, they must also be efficient, easy to use 
and appropriate to the size and type of organization in which they operate.  
e) 
Depth protection means that it must be assumed that an intruder will attempt to use any 
available means of penetration. This does not necessarily entail the most obvious means,

nor is it necessarily the one against which the most solid defense has been installed.  
f) 
Due diligence means that ensuring network security is an ongoing, evolving process. The 
network must be perpetually monitored and managed to ensure security.  
 
1.5 
Key Network Security Definitions 
 
1.5.1 General Statement. In information technology, a network is a series of points or nodes 
interconnected by communication paths. Networks can further be defined by their topology or 
general configurations. Networks can also be characterized in terms of spatial distance as Local 
Area Networks (LANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs). Further characterizations can be 
accomplished by referencing the type of data transmission technology in use; by whether it 
carries voice, data, or both kinds of signals; by users of the network; by the nature of its 
connections; and by the types of physical links. 
 
1.5.2 Network Security Objectives. Network security equates to the protection of networks and 
their services from unauthorized modification, destruction, or disclosure, and provision of 
assurance that the network performs its critical functions correctly and that all software on the 
network is an authentic copy of the original software as distributed by its manufacturer. Network 
security also helps to ensure the integrity of data that traverses the network.

used to determine where messages transmitted on the 
Internet should be delivered. The IP address is analogous to 
a house number for ordinary postal mail.  
IP Security –  
(IPSec)  
 IPsec is a protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol (IP) 
communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP 
packet of a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for 
establishing mutual authentication between agents at the 
beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic 
keys to be used during the session.  IPsec is an Institute of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard, 
Request For Comments (RFC) 2411, protocol that provides 
security capabilities at the Internet Protocol (IP) layer of 
communications. IPsec’s key management protocol is used 
to negotiate the secret keys that protect Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) communications, and the level and type of 
security protections that will characterize the VPN. The 
most widely used key management protocol is the Internet 
Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.   
Kerberos - 
A network authentication protocol designed to provide 
strong authentication for client/server applications by using 
secret-key cryptography. 
Key –  
A value used to control cryptographic operations, such as 
decryption, encryption, signature generation or signature 
verification.  
Malware –  
A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, 
with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, 
or operating system or of otherwise annoying or disrupting 
the victim.  
Message Authentication Code –  
(MAC)  
A cryptographic checksum on data that uses a symmetric 
key to detect both accidental and intentional modifications 
of the data.  
Non-repudiation –  
Assurance that the sender of information is provided with 
proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of 
the sender’s identity, so neither can later deny having 
processed the information.  
Password –  
A secret that a claimant memorizes and uses to authenticate 
his or her identity. Passwords are typically character 
strings. 
A protected character string used to authenticate the 
identity of a computer system user or to authorize access to 
system resources.  
A string of characters (letters, numbers, and other symbols) 
used to authenticate an identity or to verify access

authorization. 
Personal Identification Number –  
(PIN)  
A password consisting only of decimal digits. 
A secret code that a claimant memorizes and uses to 
authenticate his or her identity. PINS are generally only 
decimal digits. 
An alphanumeric code or password used to authenticate an 
identity. 
Phishing –  
Tricking individuals into disclosing sensitive personal 
information through deceptive computer-based means.  
Policy (for Security) –  
A document that delineates the security management 
structure and clearly assigns security responsibilities and 
lays the foundation necessary to reliably measure progress 
and compliance  
Port –  
A physical entry or exit point of a cryptographic module 
that provides access to the module for physical signals, 
represented by logical information flows (physically 
separated ports do not share the same physical pin or wire). 
Private Key –  
The secret part of an asymmetric key pair that is typically 
used to digitally sign or decrypt data.  Asymmetric key 
encryption uses different keys for encryption and 
decryption. These two keys are mathematically related and 
they form a key pair. 
Proxy –  
A proxy is an application that “breaks” the connection 
between client and server. The proxy accepts certain types 
of traffic entering or leaving a network and processes it and 
forwards it. This effectively closes the straight path 
between the internal and external networks. Making it more 
difficult for an attacker to obtain internal addresses and 
other details of the organization’s internal network. Proxy 
servers are available for common Internet services; for 
example, an Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) proxy 
used for Web access, and an Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP) proxy used for e-mail.  
Public Key –  
The public part of an asymmetric key pair that is typically 
used to verify signatures or encrypt data.  
Remote Access –  
Access by users (or information systems) communicating 
external to an information system security perimeter.  
Risk–  
The likelihood of a threat being successful in its attack 
against a network.  
Secure Communication Protocol –  
A communication protocol that provides the appropriate  
confidentiality, 
authentication 
and 
content 
integrity 
protection.  
Social Engineering –  
An attempt to trick someone into revealing information

(e.g., a password) that can be used to attack systems or 
networks.  
Threat –  
Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely 
impact network operations (including mission, functions, 
image, or reputation), assets, or individuals through an 
information system via unauthorized access, destruction, 
disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of 
service. Also, the potential for a threat-source to 
successfully exploit a particular information system 
vulnerability.  A threat is any potential danger to a network 
that someone or something may be able to identify as being 
vulnerable, and therefore seek to exploit. 
Unauthorized Access –  
A person gains logical or physical access without 
permission to a network, system, application, data, or other 
resource.  
Verification and Validation 
Ensuring by electronic signature checking that any software 
package is an authentic copy of the software created by its 
manufacturer and, if applicable, an exact copy of the 
software as certified by the ITL.  Standards for verification 
and validation are addressed within other applicable GLI 
Standards. 
Virtual LAN –  
(VLAN)  
A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a group of hosts with a common 
set of requirements that communicate as if they were 
attached to the same broadcast domain, regardless of their 
physical location.  A VLAN has the same attributes as a 
physical LAN, but it allows for end stations to be grouped 
together even if they are not located on the same network 
switch.  VLANs are created to provide the segmentation 
services traditionally provided by routers in LAN 
configurations.  VLANs are implemented by adding a 
header to each frame that contains “tags” to identify which 
LAN the frame belongs to. 
Virtual Private Network –  
(VPN)  
A Virtual Private Network is a logical network that is 
established over an existing physical network and which 
typically does not include every node present on the 
physical network.  
Virus –  
A self-replicating program, typically with malicious intent, 
that runs and spreads by modifying other programs or files. 
Vulnerability –  
Software, hardware, or other weaknesses in a network that 
can provide a “door” to introducing a threat.

1.6 
Key Network operator / Stakeholder Documentation 
 
1.6.1 Identification of Risk. There is no completely secure system. Therefore. It is necessary to 
define which portions of the business require the greatest resources targeted at security. Each 
discrete unit in an organization will have some portion of its core functionality dependent in 
information technology and should be an interested party. Each interested party should be able to 
define which specific functions are at risk from data loss, tampering, or leakage. This can be 
considered to be the first step in a risk analysis which should be used as a basis for the 
Information Security policies. 
 
1.6.2 Information Security Policies (prevention).  A detailed Security Policy (hereafter "the 
policy") is required to identify, document, and support the many facets of network security 
described throughout this document.  Development of the policy should be predicated upon 
performance of a detailed risk analysis.  The policy document should be developed, 
implemented, and maintained by the network operators / stakeholders and shall 
 
a) 
Be formally documented and reviewed regularly. 
b) 
Define employee expectations and responsibilities, and establish consequences for failure 
to follow policy, and additionally: 
i. 
Define roles and responsibilities within the organization for information security. 
ii. 
Set the vision of senior management in regards to security. 
iii. 
Define protection requirements in accordance with the risk assessment. 
iv. 
Incorporate employee awareness training, which should be done at time of hire 
and annually thereafter. 
 
1.6.3 Incident Response Policy (response).  An Incident Response Policy (IRP) is essential to 
ensuring that network security threats are responded to in a timely and effective manner 
should preventive measures fail or be compromised.  A detailed IRP document should be 
developed, implemented, and maintained by the network operator / stakeholder and shall:

a) 
Be formally documented and tested annually. 
b) 
Define roles and responsibilities during an incident. 
c) 
Define a communication plan both internally and externally (media). 
 
1.6.4 Disaster Recovery Plan (recovery).  High-level practices and procedures should be 
established to help in the event of the failure of critical infrastructure, and to help control damage 
in the event that preventative network security measures are unsuccessful in warding off an 
attack. A detailed Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) document should be developed, implemented, 
and maintained by the network operator / stakeholder and shall ensure that: 
 
a) 
Personnel are trained and familiar with related procedures. 
b) 
Data backups are performed and maintained and sent off-site at regular intervals 
(preferably daily). 
c) 
Multiple data centers are designed into the network operations. 
d) 
High availability systems are effectively utilized which keep both the data and system 
replicated off-site. 
 
Special Note:  A Disaster Recovery Plan is viewed as the principal responsibility of the network 
operator versus something that a network supplier is accountable for.  That said, any credible 
DRP should involve and utilize the specific expertise and knowledge that the network supplier 
has to offer.  Additionally, not all networks warrant the development and maintenance of a 
formal DRP, since they may be small-scale, unsophisticated networks that carry data of low 
sensitivity.  Network operator internal controls should dictate the necessity for a DRP subject to 
the type of network in use and the nature of the data that is transmitted over that network.

Networking Devices  
 
2.1.1 Types of Networking Devices. The table below briefly summarizes a variety of 
networking devices commonly used in modern-day networks. 
TABLE 2.1.1 - NETWORKING DEVICES SUMMARY 
Device 
Function/Purpose 
Key Points 
Hub 
Connects devices on a twisted-pair 
network. 
A hub does not perform any 
tasks besides signal 
regeneration. 
Switch 
Connects devices on an 802.3 
network. 
A switch forwards data to its 
destination by using the MAC 
address embedded in each 
packet. 
Bridge 
Divides networks to reduce overall 
network traffic. 
A bridge allows or prevents 
data from passing through it 
by reading the MAC address. 
Router 
Connects networks together. 
A router uses the software-
configured network address to 
make forwarding decisions. 
Gateway 
Translates from one data format to 
another. 
Gateways can be hardware or 
software based. Any device 
that translates data formats is 
called a gateway. 
Channel Services Unit / Digital 
Services Unit (CSU/DSU) 
Translates digital signals used on a 
LAN to those used on a WAN. 
CSU/DSU functionality is 
sometimes incorporated into 
other devices, such as a router 
with a WAN connection. 
Network Interface Card (NIC) 
Enables computer terminals and 
systems to connect to the network. 
Network interfaces can be add-
in expansion cards, PCMCIA 
cards, or built-in interfaces.  
Integrated Services Digital 
Connects devices to ISDN lines. 
ISDN is a digital WAN

Device 
Function/Purpose 
Key Points 
Network (ISDN) terminal 
adapter 
technology often used in place 
of slower modem links. ISDN 
terminal adapters are required 
to reformat the data format for 
transmission on ISDN links.  
System area network card 
Used in server clusters to provide 
connectivity between nodes. 
System area network cards are 
high-performance devices 
capable of coping with the 
demands of clustering 
applications. 
Wireless Access Point (WAP) 
Provides network capabilities to 
wireless network devices. 
A WAP is often used to 
connect to a wired network, 
thereby acting as a link 
between wired and wireless 
portions of the network. 
Modem 
Provides serial communication 
capabilities across phone lines. 
Modems modulate the digital 
signal into analog at the 
sending end and perform the 
reverse function at the 
receiving end. 
 
2.1.2 Key Networking Device Descriptions. 
 
a) 
Hubs: Hubs are the simplest network devices and simply broadcast the same information 
to all connected ports including the originating port. On a hub, data is forwarded to all 
ports, regardless of whether the data is intended for the system connected to the port. 
Computers connect to a hub via a length of twisted-pair cabling. In addition to ports for 
connecting computers, most hubs have a port designated as an uplink port that enables 
the hub to be connected to another hub to create larger networks. 
b) 
Switches: On the surface, a switch looks much like a hub. Multiple switches can be used, 
like hubs, to create larger networks. Despite their similarity in appearance and their 
identical physical connections to computers, switches offer significant operational 
advantages over hubs. Rather than forwarding data to all the connected ports, a switch 
forwards data only to the port on which the destination system is connected. It looks at 
the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses of the devices connected to it to determine

the correct port. A MAC address is a unique number that is programmed into every NIC. 
By forwarding data only to the system to which the data is addressed, the switch 
decreases the amount of traffic on each network link dramatically. In effect, the switch 
channels or switches data between the ports.   
c) 
Bridges: Bridges are networking devices that divide up networks. A bridge functions by 
blocking or forwarding data, based on the destination MAC address written into each 
frame of data. If the bridge believes the destination address is on a network other than 
that from which the data was received, it can forward the data to the other networks to 
which it is connected. If the address is not on the other side of the bridge, the data is 
blocked from passing. Bridges "learn" the MAC addresses of devices on connected 
networks by "listening" to network traffic and recording the network from which the 
traffic originates.  The advantages of bridges are simple and significant. By preventing 
unnecessary traffic from crossing onto other network segments, a bridge can dramatically 
reduce the amount of network traffic on a segment. Bridges also make it possible to 
isolate a busy network from a not-so-busy one, thereby preventing pollution from busy 
nodes.  When a Wireless Access Point allows communication between wireless clients 
and wired clients, then it is acting as a bridge between these networks. 
d) 
Routers: Routers are network devices that literally route data among computer networks 
beyond directly connected devices. By examining data as it arrives, the router is able to 
determine the destination address for the data; then, by using tables of defined routes, the 
router determines the best way for the data to continue its journey. Unlike bridges and 
switches, which use the hardware-configured MAC address to determine the destination 
of the data, routers use the software-configured network address to make decisions.  
e) 
Gateways: The term gateway is applied to any device, system, or software application 
that can perform the function of translating data from one format to another. The key 
feature of a gateway is that it converts the format of the data, not the data itself. 
f) 
Wireless Access Points (WAPs): WAPs are hub-like devices, typically with a protruding 
antennae.  They allow connectivity via an air interface. A WAP serves as a link between 
wired and wireless portions of a network.

g) 
Modems: Modems perform a simple function: They translate digital signals from a 
computer into analog signals that can travel across conventional phone lines. The modem 
modulates the signal at the sending end and demodulates at the receiving end. Modems 
provide a relatively slow method of communication.  
h) 
Network Interface Cards (NICs): Network Interface Cards (NICs), sometimes called 
simply network cards, are the mechanisms by which computers connect to a network.  
 
2.2 
Physical Access Controls and Security 
 
2.2.1 General Statement. Physical security equates to the ability to permit or deny the use of a 
particular resource by a particular entity through some physical or tangible means. Physical 
security is an important component of the protection of any network.  Physical access controls 
are security features that control how users and systems communicate and interact with other 
systems and resources, and they serve to protect the systems and resources from unauthorized 
access.  Physical network security should address the key areas of theft, sabotage, vandalism, 
accidents, and environmental and/or natural calamity. 
 
2.2.2 Server Room Access. 
 
a) 
Unauthorized access to server rooms shall be prevented by the implementation of locked 
entry points and/or a swipe card system, or similar mechanism, capable of logging and/or 
controlling all entries to rooms in which systems hosting sensitive information are 
present. Some regulatory bodies require two factor authentication.  
b) 
Logs shall be routinely reviewed for any anomalies in access patterns.  
 
2.2.3 Server Rack/Cabinets Security. 
 
a) 
Server rack/cabinets shall be securely locked to create a physical barrier to accessing the 
servers.

b) 
Access to server racks/cabinets shall be restricted to authorized employees only. 
 
2.3 
Physical Ports and Wired Connections 
 
2.3.1 Network Jack Security. 
 
a) 
Network jacks shall be disabled when not in use. This may be by : 
b) 
Physical disconnection (air gap) 
c) 
Administrative, such as assigning to a special "dead" VLAN 
d) 
Installing a locked box or jack plug.  
e) 
A log of enabled network jacks shall be maintained and audited regularly.  
f) 
Requests and approvals for jack activations shall be logged by Information Technology 
(IT) staff. 
 
2.3.2 Networking Devices. 
 
a) 
Where networking devices are not in the server room,access to networking devices 
(routers, firewalls, switches, etc.) shall be restricted to authorized employees only. 
b) 
Networking devices shall reside in a secure environment. 
 
2.3.3 Unnecessary Service and Ports. 
 
a) 
Networking devices shall have unnecessary/unused services turned off and non-essential 
ports disabled.  (NOTE:  The network supplier should be consulted prior to the 
deactivation of any services or ports to ensure that an essential service/port is not 
inadvertently disabled.  For example, many essential services only run sporadically, so 
usage by itself is not always a reliable measure of importance.)

b) 
Proper design and build of the network shall be followed for all new network 
configurations to ensure that the appropriate security controls are implemented. 
 
2.4 
Disaster Recovery and Redundancy (Physical) 
 
2.4.1 Disaster Recovery and Redundancy. Network redundancy involves making resources 
available in case of failure and making those resources available as seamlessly as possible and 
with little manual interaction in the event they are needed.  Disaster recovery means having a 
plan in case of catastrophic failure to return access to resources quickly.  The network shall 
utilize one or more of the following items to support disaster recovery and redundancy: 
 
a) 
Redundant Hardware – The network shall utilize multiple pieces of hardware, such as 
NICs, that operate in parallel.  In the event one fails, the other will continue to function. 
b) 
High-Availability – The network shall employ multiple pieces of hardware, such as 
routers, that are identical, and configured in such a way that if the primary hardware 
component fails, the secondary one will take over with little or no administrative 
interaction. 
c) 
Swappable Hardware / Cold Spares – Exact copies of hardware shall be maintained, such 
that in the event of a failure, that hardware can be readily swapped or replaced.  This 
includes hardware that is not fully configured in a working capacity, but which can be 
taken from inventory, configured, and implemented in the network in fairly short order in 
the event of a component failure.  This reduces or eliminates the downtime associated 
with repairing the original hardware component or acquiring and configuring a brand new 
replacement. 
d) 
Mirroring – The network shall utilize mirroring.  Mirroring typically applies to data 
storage and is the process of having all data, including changes, replicated to a second 
location in real-time.  This replication process allows for either a hardware swap or the 
restoration of data in the event of a failure.

e) 
Backup Data Centers – The network shall employ multiple data centers or sites – namely, 
a primary and secondary site.  The secondary site can be utilized in the event of a major 
emergency and/or natural disaster or other calamity at the primary site. 
i. 
Cold Backup Site – The least expensive but most time consuming.  A Cold 
backup site is nothing more than an appropriately-configured space in a building.  
Everything required to restore network service must be procured and delivered. 
ii. 
Warm Backup Site – A site already stocked with hardware representing a 
reasonable facsimile of that found at the primary site.  Typically, the most recent 
data backups must be delivered and a restore must be performed. 
iii. 
Hot Backup Site – The most expensive but quickest for recovery.  A hot site 
generally contains a virtual mirror of the current site with systems essentially at-
the-ready to be activated at a moment’s notice. 
 
With regards to Backup Data Centers, the term “site” may refer to physical space that is 
collocated or geographically separated.  Geographic separation may offer the greatest security, 
redundancy, and survivability, but it also comes at the greatest expense.  Therefore, this is a 
business decision that the network operator must evaluate in conjunction with the specific 
network and data involved. 
 
2.4.2 Disaster Recovery Plan. – As described earlier in this document, a Disaster Recovery 
Plan (DRP) shall carefully document all methods that are utilized to support disaster recovery of 
the network. This plan should also document essential contact information and should detail the 
required steps to affect a full recovery of the network.  All key members and upper management 
should have multiple forms of access to the DRP document, both in electronic and printed form, 
and the plan should be reviewed frequently to address changes to sites, equipment, procedures, 
and personnel. 
 
2.4.3 Network Backup. The following items for information backup are required to ensure 
network security:

a) 
the necessary level of back-up information shall be defined and a disaster recovery plan 
documented; 
b) 
accurate and complete records of the backup copies and documented restoration 
procedures shall be produced; 
c) 
the extent (e.g. full or differential backup) and frequency of backups shall reflect the 
business requirements of the organization, the security requirements of the information 
involved, and the criticality of the information to the continued operation of the 
organization; 
d) 
the backups shall be stored in a remote location, at a sufficient distance to escape any 
damage from a disaster at the main site but still retrievable in a timely manner to maintain 
data availability; 
e) 
backup information shall be given an appropriate level of physical and environmental 
protection consistent with the standards applied at the main site; the controls applied to 
media at the main site shall be extended to cover the back-up site; 
f) 
backup media shall be regularly tested to ensure that they can be relied upon for 
emergency use when necessary; 
g) 
restoration procedures shall be regularly checked and tested to ensure that they are 
effective and that they can be completed within the time allotted in the operational 
procedures for recovery; 
h) 
in situations where confidentiality is of importance, backups shall be protected by means 
of encryption.  While NIST does not specifically require backup encryption, they do 
maintain standards for encryption of data storage, and backup data may be viewed as an 
extension to that. 
 
Special Note:  Disaster Recovery, a Disaster Recovery Plan, and Network Backup must be 
assessed in the context of the network in question.  Some networks do not warrant one or more of 
these approaches.  A proper risk analysis should be performed for the network in conjunction 
with a cost-benefit analysis to determine which approach is needed and to what extent it is 
financially prudent.

CHAPTER 3 
3.0 NETWORK SOFTWARE 
 
3.1 
Protocols and Communications 
 
3.1.1 Network Protocols. This section summarizes commonly-used networking protocols.  The 
specific protocol that is appropriate for implementation in a given network is beyond the scope 
of this document.  However, Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a 
pervasive protocol used in the majority of modern-day networks. 
 
a) 
UUCP (UNIX-to-UNIX Copy Protocol) – a set of Unix programs used for sending files 
between different Unix systems and for sending commands to be executed on another 
system. 
b) 
TCP / UDP – Transport method protocols utilized as part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  
TCP ensures that data arrives intact and complete, while UDP just sends out packet.  TCP 
is used for everything that must arrive in perfect form and UDP is used for functions like 
streaming media and video conferencing where it is impossible to transmit erroneous or 
dropped packets. 
c) 
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) – A widely used network monitoring 
and control protocol that is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  SNMP agents collect and 
analyze data that is passed to discover and analyze traffic patterns. 
d) 
RMON (Remote Monitoring) – Enhancement to the SNMP protocol that adds a 
comprehensive set of network monitoring capabilities and allows for much more 
information about a network to be passed to a remote location. 
e) 
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – A function in both software and the 
operating system of most hardware that allows for automatically assigned temporary IP 
addresses to be assigned on a request basis.

f) 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - A widely used protocol for moving files across unknown 
or heterogeneous networks. 
 
3.1.2 Secure Communications.  
 
a) 
All confidential communications shall employ some form of encryption that has been 
approved by the network operators / stakeholders.  
b) 
All confidential data communication shall incorporate an error detection and correction 
scheme approved by the network operators / stakeholders to ensure the data is transmitted 
and received accurately.  
c) 
The network shall be capable of detecting and displaying certain conditions. These 
conditions shall be recorded in an error log that may be displayed or printed on demand, 
and shall archive the conditions for a minimum of ninety (90) days: 
i. 
Power reset or failure of any component of the network.  
ii. 
Communication loss between any component of the network.  
iii. 
Authentication failure. This may be either a logon failure or key exchange failure. 
 
3.2 
Firewalls 
 
3.2.1 General Statement. A firewall is simply a group of components that collectively form a 
barrier between two networks. Implementation of suitable firewalls is strongly recommended.  
The following key requirements shall apply to a firewall: 
 
a) 
Firewall technology shall be implemented at network edges to protect against 
unauthorized access of internal information assets.  
b) 
All external and Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) traffic shall be routed through firewall 
devices. Network trafficking rules shall be applied in line with operational design. 
c) 
Network trafficking rules shall include but not be limited to the following: 
i. 
Allow for stateful connection monitoring. 
ii. 
An incoming packet shall not have a source address of the internal network,

iii. 
An incoming packet shall not contain Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) 
traffic, 
iv. 
An incoming packet shall have a publicly registered destination address 
associated with the internal network if using static or dynamic Network Address 
Translation (NAT), 
v. 
An outgoing packet shall have a source address of the internal network, 
vi. 
An outgoing packet shall not have a destination address of the internal network, 
vii. 
An incoming or outgoing packet shall not have a source or destination address 
that is private or in a reserved space,  
viii. 
Sources of traffic from Internet sites that are known to contain spam, offensive 
material, etc., should preferably be blocked.  
ix. 
Any source routed packets or any packets with the Internet Protocol (IP) options 
field set shall be blocked.  
x. 
Inbound or outbound traffic containing source or destination addresses of 
127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0, link local (169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255), or directed 
broadcast addresses shall be blocked. 
d) 
When required to allow services, such as voice (Voice over IP - VoIP), instant 
messaging, presence, mobility services, multimedia (Multimedia over IP - MoIP), etc., to 
securely traverse network borders and NAT functionality, firewall technologies shall 
include the following additional rules:  
i. 
Use a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy server or H.323 gatekeeper outside 
the firewall, with the firewall configured to allow communication of endpoints 
only with the proxy server, or  
ii. 
Be configured to function as application-layer gateways that monitor all SIP and 
H.323 traffic in order to open and close restricted ports as required and rewrite the 
IP addresses within the unencrypted application-layer messages, or  
iii. 
Use a Session Border Controller (SBC), also known as an application router, to 
allow for end-to-end VoIP communications across multiple IP networks while 
allowing VoIP endpoints such as VoIP gateways, IP phones, and IP soft phones;

which are behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) firewall, to communicate 
with VoIP endpoints on external IP networks. 
e) 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft proposals for NAT traversal, such as 
Connection Oriented Media Transport, Middlebox Communications (Midcom), Simple 
Traversal of UDP through NAT (STUN), and Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN), 
when taken singularly, do not provide a complete, comprehensive solution. IETF Internet 
Draft Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a proposed methodology for NAT 
traversal for SIP. ICE makes use of existing protocols, such as STUN, TURN, and even 
Realm Specific IP (RSIP). ICE works through the cooperation of both endpoints in a 
session. 
f) 
Remote management of firewall technologies shall be via encrypted communications or 
disallowed entirely.  
g) 
Firewall policies shall be reviewed, tested, and audited, on a frequency determined and 
documented by the network operator / stakeholder. 
 
3.2.2 Multiple Networks. In the event a particular network server is utilized in conjunction 
with other networks, all communications, including remote access, shall pass through at least one 
approved application-level firewall and must not have a facility that allows for an alternate 
network path. If an alternate network path exists for redundancy purposes, it shall also pass 
through at least one application-level firewall. 
 
3.2.3 Firewall Audit Logs. The firewall application must maintain an audit log of the following 
information and must disable all communications and generate an error event if the audit log 
becomes full: 
 
a) 
all changes to configuration of the firewall;  
b) 
all successful and unsuccessful connection attempts* through the firewall; the number of 
unsuccessful connection attempts shall be a configurable parameter by the network 
operator / stakeholder; and

c) 
the source and destination IP addresses and port numbers for ingress traffic; and 
Note: In cases where a NAT firewall does not have the capability to log the destination IP 
address if found in its NAT Forward Table, logging of the destination IP address is not 
necessary. 
d) 
MAC addresses for egress traffic.  At a minimum, the initial successful connection with a 
new MAC address. 
 
* Please note, a configurable parameter, ‘unsuccessful connection attempts’, may be utilized to 
deny further connection requests should the predefined threshold be exceeded. The network 
operators / stakeholders must also be notified. 
 
3.3 
Password Protection and Logins 
 
3.3.1 Device Passwords and Settings. 
 
a) 
Device passwords shall be immediately changed before or upon device installation and 
shall conform to requirements set forth by the network security policy; 
b) 
Networking devices shall be configured to retain their current configuration, security 
settings, passwords, etc., during a reset or reboot process; 
c) 
All administrative passwords shall be changed regularly (recommended every 45 days), 
or minimally, any time IT staff leave the organization.  Password aging is strongly 
recommended; 
d) 
Only individual accounts that are uniquely tied to an individual shall be utilized – no 
shared or generic accounts shall be used except for those used for read-only access, as 
described elsewhere in this document; 
e) 
Access for terminated or suspended employees shall be removed within 24 hours of 
notification;

f) 
Access for employees who have been transferred to other departments shall be removed 
in cases where that employee’s new job function are no longer related to their previous 
access rights; 
g) 
Thresholds shall be configurable to allow only a certain number of unsuccessful logon 
attempts via a given user’s password.  Once the threshold is exceeded, the account shall 
require administrative intervention to unlock*; and 
*Please note that account lockouts can themselves be leveraged as a Denial of Service attack. 
 
NOTE: 
GLI recommends the following minimum password criteria: 
1) 
8 – 14 characters in length; 
2) 
A combination of at least three of the following components: 
 
Uppercase letters 
 
Lowercase letters 
 
Numbers 
 
Special characters 
3) 
Not part of the user’s login name; 
4) 
Not be part of the previous password (example last password was 
“Doggie79” new one shouldn’t be “Doggie80”); and 
5) 
Should avoid personal information of the user that someone could know 
about (i.e. birthday, kid’s names, etc.). 
 
It is important to note here that the above guidelines for passwords and settings are based upon 
recommendations provided by industry standards organizations such as NIST, ISO, and IEEE.  
While sufficiently complex passwords are effective in and of themselves, they can also be 
easily compromised by end-users.  For example, if the passwords are difficult to remember, 
many end-users simply opt to write them down, thus undermining their benefit.  This tradeoff 
should be considered when establishing any password regimen.

3.3.2 Logins. All network users shall have a unique identifier (user ID or login) for their 
specific use only, and a suitable authentication technique should be chosen to substantiate the 
claimed identity of a user. 
 
a) 
User IDs shall be capable of tracing activities to the responsible individual. Regular user 
activities shall not be performed from privileged accounts. In exceptional circumstances 
where there is a clear need, the use of a shared user ID for a group of users or a specific 
job function can be used. Generic IDs for use by an individual should only be allowed 
either where the functions accessible or actions carried out by the ID do not need to be 
traced (e.g. read only access), or where there are other controls in place (e.g., password 
for a generic ID only issued to one staff at a time and logging such an isolated instance). 
b) 
Where strong authentication and identity verification is required, authentication methods 
alternative to passwords, such as smart cards, tokens, or biometric means, are strongly 
recommended. 
 
3.4 
Multi-layered Protection 
 
3.4.1 General Statement. Multi-layered protection shall be deployed wherever and whenever 
possible.  Networks with different functions shall be implemented separately. For example, slot 
accounting and ticketing networks shall be kept separate and non-routable if possible. This 
approach keeps any successful intrusion isolated.  Multiple security layers should be 
implemented to complement one another insofar as what one misses, the other catches. 
 
3.5 
Encryption – Transmission and Storage 
 
3.5.1 Transmission Encryption Technologies. All networks and security protocols shall 
deploy and support encryption suited to the communication method for the transmission of 
confidential or sensitive data/information.  Note that what constitutes “confidential or sensitive 
data/information” can vary widely.  At a minimum, highly personal information such as PINs

and Social Security Numbers would be viewed as confidential.  The importance of other data 
may vary as a function of how critical that data is to the integrity of the network and/or the needs 
of the business.  The network operator must assess the type of data items that the network carries 
and determine the relative sensitivity of this information.  This assessment will then serve as a 
guide to the types of security measures that are appropriate for the network. 
 
3.5.2 Additional Protection Methods. Protection methods listed below shall also be considered 
and utilized as technically feasible for additional protection of the network:  
 
a) 
IPSec– A suite of authentication and encryption protocols suitable for all types of Internet 
Protocol (IP) traffic that is used to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  IPSec allows 
confidential information to be sent securely between two end-stations or networks over 
an un-trusted communications medium.  This shall be considered as a technology for 
securing Internet and other IP communications in connecting authorized external 
customers at defined locations; 
b) 
Secure Shell (SSH) – Shall be deployed solely for the remote administration of 
confidential data/information and their systems; 
c) 
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) – The Secure Sockets Layer specification shall be deployed 
to provide secure access to confidential data/information on web servers.  When SSL is 
used to protect confidential information, the most current version shall be used with 128-
bit encryption; 
d) 
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) – Shall be deployed in environments where data-link-
layer encryption is not a practical solution to maintain and operate.  VPN technology 
using IPSec or SSL encryption can be implemented independently from a particular link-
layer communications technology (e.g., High-Level Data Link Control/HDLC, Frame 
Relay, Fiber Distributed Data Interface/FDDI, Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode/ATM, etc.)  As such, this best practices resource strongly encourages the 
use of VPN technology to secure confidential communications;

All Rights Reserved. 
 
 
e) 
Data-Link (symmetrical) Encryption – Shall be used in environments where Virtual 
Private Network management is not a reasonable encryption implementation to maintain 
and operate, or where the use and management of VPN technology is not warranted; 
f) 
Secure /Multipurpose Internet Email Extension (S/MIME) – like Pretty Good Privacy 
(PGP), S/MIME is a standards-based security enhancement to secure email and message 
attachments that provides strong authentication through digital signatures, message 
confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation.   
g) 
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) – Shall be used to protect sensitive information, transmitted 
via e-mail, using a minimum key-size of 2048 bits.  Public key information may be 
maintained on public or internal PGP key servers.   
h) 
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) – Recommended PKI-based technical functionality is 
defined by Standard X.509 and its extensions, in the evolving definition developed by the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), through the PKIX Standards Development Task 
Group. This document provides and defines certified identification of digital signatures 
having integrity, non-repudiation, and authentication.  
 
3.5.3 Disk {Storage} Encryption. 
 
a) 
Anywhere sensitive information is stored on disk it shall utilize some form of encryption. 
b) 
Databases that are used to store sensitive or protected information shall be configured to 
enable encryption by default.  The encryption of sensitive database fields is also 
acceptable if another method is used to prevent network sniffing. 
 
3.5.4 Storage Encryption Technologies. All confidential data/information residing on Direct 
Attached Storage (DAS) devices, Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices, Storage Area 
Network (SAN) devices, and all portable storage devices3, shall be encrypted and shall employ at 
least one or more of the encryption methods listed below for the protection of confidential data 
and protected information:

a) 
Full-Disk Encryption – Encrypts all data on a hard drive for a client device. This includes 
the entire operating system, all applications, and all data/information.  Full-disk 
encryption software contains components that are independent of the operating system 
and execute before the operating system is loaded as well as authentication.  The system 
is rendered unintelligible and unusable in the event of a cyber crime or terrorism.  
i. 
Full-Disk Encryption shall have the following capabilities:  Pre-boot 
authentication for laptops/table PC’s; file and folder-based encryption capabilities 
built into the operating system; supports single sign-on; remote install capability; 
supports multiple algorithms and has the ability to disable supported and 
unsupported algorithms in the event of conflict. 
b) 
File (Folder) Encryption – Provides encryption for specific files or folders.  File-
encryption solutions provide automatic security since each new file/folder encryption 
capability must be manually turned off/on. 
i. 
File (Folder) Encryption shall have the following capabilities:  Must be able to 
support all state operating systems, all applications and related software programs 
in addition to productivity software for the state; ability to support a multitude of 
server(s) and file systems; provide simple recovery mechanisms for the recovery 
of lost keys of encrypted files/folders; integrate seamlessly with mobile email; 
supports security concepts and methods of “separation of duties”. 
c) 
Back-up and Archive Media Encryption – Provides benefits not only for protecting data 
in storage but also in the disposal of backup media.  Many privacy regulations include 
disposal of back-up and archive media, while disclosure regulations generally dictate a 
retention period for back-up and archive data.  Without encryption, media disposal is 
difficult; therefore, many entities keep back-up and archive media longer than needed or 
legally prudent.  By deleting the encryption key, media is rendered unreadable.  With a 
rotating key sequence, a regular pattern of retention and disposal can be automatically 
enforced. 
i. 
Back-up and Archive Media Encryption shall have the following capabilities:  
Integrates seamlessly into the backup process and devices; offers flexible options

for data restoration and disaster recovery and supports various backup media 
types used by the state. 
d) 
Mass Storage (SAN/NAS) Encryption – provides for encrypting large volumes of active 
data/information.  Mass storage devices refer to a Storage Area Network (SAN) and 
Network-Attached Storage (NAS) data management solutions.  Recently, the boundaries 
between NAS and SAN systems have overlapped with some products providing both file 
level protocols (NAS) and block level protocols (SAN).   
i. 
Mass Storage (SAN/NAS) Encryption shall have the following capabilities:  
Supports encryption throughout the lifecycle of all data/information whether in 
storage or in transit; encryption and decryption methods must have both logical 
and physical segmentations; provide efficient encryption/decryption across 
multiple mass storage device types including fiber channel disks within an IP 
based network environment.  
e) 
Database Encryption – Entails encrypting physical data within a database by encrypting 
the entire database, or calling functions, or stored procedures and database triggers, or 
natively using Database Management System (DBMS) encryption features to encrypt all 
or in part (column, row, or field level). Database encryption can be implemented at the 
application level.   
i. 
Database Encryption shall have the following capabilities:  Supports symmetric 
and asymmetrical encryption; ability to perform column/row level encryption vs. 
full database encryption for greater flexibility; supports multiple database 
platforms and operating systems; ability to encrypt and decrypt at the application 
and/or field level; supports separation of duties between the database 
administrator and the “key” administrator.

f) 
Encryption for Removable Storage Drives and Devices – Provides encryption for smaller 
portable devices and existing datasets.  A Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive 
comprises a memory card that plugs into a computer’s USB port and functions as a 
portable hard-drive that does not contain moving parts.  A USB flash drive is commonly 
known as a “flash drive,” “thumb drive”, “pen drive”, “keychain drive”, “key drive”, 
“USB key”, “USB stick”, or “memory key”. 
i. 
Encryption for Removable Storage Drives and Devices shall have the following 
capabilities:  USB flash drives must have password/security capabilities built into 
the device.  USB flash drives and removable storage devices can be purchased 
with encryption software installed on the device hardware, or file-encryption 
software can be purchased after-the-fact for installation.   
 
3.5.5 Encryption Keys Minimum Width. The minimum width (size) for encryption keys shall 
be 128 bits for symmetric algorithms and 1024 bits for public keys.  
 
3.5.6 Encryption Key Handling. There must be a secure method implemented for changing the 
current encryption key set. It is not acceptable to only use the current key set to “encrypt” the 
next set. An example of an acceptable method of exchanging keys is the use of public key 
encryption techniques to transfer new key sets. 
 
3.5.7 Encryption Key Storage. There must be a secure method in place for the storage of any 
encryption keys. Encryption keys must not be stored without being encrypted themselves. 
 
3.6 
External Connections 
 
3.6.1  General Statement. External connections to operational networks shall be routed 
through secure gateways and protected by at least one of the following encryption methods, as 
applicable:

a) 
Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) shall be employed 
between a web server and browser to authenticate the web server and, optionally, the 
user’s browser. Implementations of TLS and SSL shall allow for client authentication 
support using the services provided by Certificate Authorities. The use of SSLv2 and 
TLSv1.0 are deprecated as of the publication date of this document. 
b) 
IP Security (IPSec) shall be used to extend the IP communications protocol, providing 
end-to-end confidentiality for data packets traveling over the Internet. The appropriate 
mode of IPSec shall be used commensurate with the level of security required for the data 
being transmitted: sender authentication and integrity without confidentiality or sender 
authentication and integrity with confidentiality. 
c) 
VPNs shall be used to interconnect two networks that traverse and communicate over 
insecure networks, such as the public Internet, by establishing a secure link, typically 
between firewalls, using an industry accepted cryptographic tunneling protocol such as 
IPSec or L2TP.  VPNs are recommended for use in remote access. 
d) 
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a client/ server software 
protocol that enables network access servers to communicate with a central server to 
authenticate and authorize remote users to access systems or services; strong 
authentication shall be used for dial-up modem systems.  
e) 
Dial-up desktop workstation modems shall be disabled and removed. The use of 
hardware and inventory scanning tools to verify the presence and configuration of dial 
utilities and modems shall be implemented. Any use of dial-up modem systems shall 
adhere to policies accepted by the network operator / stakeholder which shall include: 
i. 
A complete, current list of all authorized personnel having modem access 
privileges. 
ii. 
Automatic disconnection after a specified period of inactivity. Inactivity 
parameters shall be determined by the network operator / stakeholder in line with 
operational needs. 
iii. 
The recommended use of security tokens. 
iv. 
Immediate termination of modem access privileges upon employment transfer, re-
assignment, or termination.

f) 
Where data sensitivity dictates, strong authentication, such as challenge/response devices, 
one-time passwords, tokens, Kerberos, and smart cards, shall be used once permission to 
connect has been granted. 
g) 
External connections shall be removed promptly when no longer required. Key network 
components shall be disabled or removed to prevent inadvertent reconnection. 
 
3.7 
Antivirus and Malware Protection Programs 
 
3.7.1 Antivirus and Malware Protection. Where applicable, antivirus and malware programs 
utilized for network security purposes shall: 
 
a) 
Be mandatory on all systems. 
b) 
Be updated automatically, or if not feasible or possible due to other constraints, be 
updated regularly through some manual means. If manual updates are required, their 
frequency shall be stated in the Security Policy. 
c) 
Include both file system scanning and real-time processing.  (Note that scans can 
adversely impact the performance of a live network, so this is a factor that should be 
considered when selecting a specific approach.) 
d) 
Ideally leverage multiple vendor solutions between host systems and gateway services 
(e.g., email gateway).  This is consistent with a multilayered implementation philosophy. 
 
3.8 
Software Updates and Patches 
 
3.8.1 General Statement. The network operators / stakeholders should develop and implement 
written procedures that outline roles and responsibilities for software updates and patch 
management that cover the following activities:

a) 
The network operators / stakeholders shall proactively monitor and address software 
vulnerabilities of all network devices (routers, firewalls, switches, servers, storage 
devices, etc.) by ensuring that applicable patches are acquired, tested, and installed in a 
timely manner. 
b) 
Where possible, patches shall be installed and validated in a test environment prior to 
their introduction to a production environment. Testing will help to expose detrimental 
impacts to software applications and/or network devices prior to implementation in a live 
network. 
c) 
Where possible, the installation of patches shall be completed with the use of automated 
tools such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) or local repositories (UNIX 
variants). The status of deployed patches shall be monitored. 
d) 
Where possible, systems configurations shall be backed up prior to patch installation. 
 
3.9 
Disaster Recovery (Logical) 
 
3.9.1 General Statement. Networks are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, ranging from 
mild (e.g., short-term power outage, disk drive failure) to severe (e.g., equipment destruction, 
fire) stemming from a variety of sources such as natural disasters, hackers, viruses, etc. While 
many vulnerabilities may be minimized or eliminated through technical, management, or 
operational solutions as part of the network operator’s / stakeholder’s risk management effort, it 
is virtually impossible to completely eliminate all risks. In many cases, critical resources may 
reside outside the network operator’s / stakeholder’s control (such as electric power or 
telecommunications), and the network operators / stakeholders may be unable to ensure their 
availability. Effective contingency planning, execution, and testing are essential to mitigate the 
risk of system and service unavailability. Disaster recovery is intended to ensure that all critical 
data is retrievable on-demand and that it can be brought back to a usable state as quickly and 
efficiently as possible.

3.9.2 Disaster Recovery Planning. Components of disaster recovery and contingency planning 
shall reflect the following criteria: 
 
a) 
Ongoing business impact analysis should be completed in an effort to identify and 
prioritize critical IT systems and components. 
b) 
Maintenance and preventative controls should be implemented to reduce the effects of 
system disruptions and increase system availability.  
c) 
Thorough recovery strategies must be implemented to ensure that the systems may be 
recovered quickly and effectively following a disruption. These strategies must include 
proper management of backup, replications, and failover systems. 
d) 
A contingency plan must be developed and adhered to and shall contain detailed 
guidance and procedures for restoring damaged systems and/or data. 
e) 
Planned testing, training, and exercises of contingency plans must occur regularly in an 
effort to expose gaps in the effectiveness of the plan execution and to ensure that 
personnel are familiar with their execution. 
f) 
Contingency plans must be living documents that are updated regularly to remain current 
with systems changes and enhancements. 
 
3.10 Intrusion Detection and Prevention 
 
3.10.1 General Statement. Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring 
in a computer system or network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are 
violations or imminent threats of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, 
or standard security practices. Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion 
detection and attempting to thwart possible incidents. 
 
3.10.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and/or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) shall be 
integrated into operational networks to proactively monitor all network devices for unauthorized 
intrusion, and shall conform to the following minimum criteria: 

GLI Standard #27 – Network Security Best Practices

Chapter Three – Network Software 
 
Page 42

All Rights Reserved. 
 
 
a) 
Intrusion Detection Systems shall be implemented both internally and externally in 
addition to existing firewall solutions. Intrusion detection logs shall be reviewed regularly 
by the network operators / stakeholders and all incidents shall be reported and resolved in 
a timely manner. 
b) 
In respect to servers, Intrusion Detection Systems shall monitor for unauthorized changes 
made to files (file integrity), especially critical system files. 
c) 
Procedures shall be implemented that provide for the review of network traffic. Network 
traffic shall be reviewed for the presence of anomalies that may be indicative of attacks 
or incorrectly configured devices. 
d) 
Intrusion Prevention Systems shall include user-defined security parameters that will help 
establish performance baselines useful in establishing an appropriate set of security 
policies.  
e) 
Application Vulnerability Description Language (AVDL) is a proposed security 
interoperability standard. AVDL creates a uniform way of describing application security 
vulnerabilities using Extensible Markup Language (XML). The XML-based technology 
will allow communication between products that find, block, fix, and report application 
security holes. Use of AVDL is recommended but not required. 
f) 
Intrusion prevention technologies can reduce the number of false alarms by focusing on 
real-time heuristic behavior rather than using signature-matching technology to identify a 
potential network attack. Intrusion prevention technologies can also prevent “zero-day” 
attacks, which exploit previously unknown weaknesses, because they respond to a change 
in the normal state of operation. However, false positives can still be common. 
g) 
IPS systems shall be utilized on systems or devices that cannot be properly patched to 
provide the appropriate level of security for those systems.  IPS devices shall also be 
utilized to protect systems with known vulnerabilities during the extended time required 
for the patch management process. 
 
3.10.3 Intrusion Protection. All servers shall have sufficient physical / logical intrusion 
protection against unauthorized access. Ideally, the system should require manufacturer and 
network operators' / stakeholders' authority, thus providing joint, but not separate, access.

Whereas an IDS is capable of detecting and reporting an unauthorized intrusion, an IPS is 
designed to prevent unauthorized access and disallow that traffic from gaining access in the first 
place. 
 
3.11 Vulnerability Scanning 
 
3.11.1 General Statement. Where practical, network and host vulnerability scanners shall be 
used to test for the vulnerabilities of internal network devices, applications, and network 
perimeter defenses, as well as adherence to security policy and standards.  
 
3.11.2 Vulnerability Scanning Tools. Where technically feasible, an automated vulnerability 
scanning tool shall be used to scan a network for known “vulnerable services” (e.g., a system 
that allows anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP), sendmail relaying, etc.). It should be noted, 
however, that some of the potential vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanning tool may 
not represent real vulnerabilities in the context of the system environment. For example, some of 
these scanning tools rate potential vulnerabilities without considering the site’s environment and 
requirements. Some of the vulnerabilities flagged by the automated scanning software may 
actually be vulnerable for a particular site but may be configured that way because the particular 
network environment requires it. 
 
3.11.3 Vulnerability Scanners. It is recommended that vulnerability scanners have the ability to 
handle the following minimum tasks: 
 
a) 
Inventory systems and services including applied patches. 
b) 
Identify security holes by confirming vulnerabilities. 
c) 
Provide comprehensive reports and charts for effective decision-making and improved 
security. 
d) 
Define and enforce valid security policies when used during security device installation 
and certification.

e) 
Use stealth scanning to verify proper operation of IDS/IPS appliances. 
f) 
Ideally vulnerability scanning should include both network and application level 
scanning. 
 
Any of the above may be replaced by a manual process when needed/desired. This may be 
especially desirable for item b) as automated tools to verify vulnerabilities can cause outages. 
 
3.12 Logging  
 
3.12.1 Security Logging. 
 
a) 
Logging capabilities shall be enabled on devices where supported.  
b) 
Logs should be reviewed, on a frequency determined and documented by the network 
operator / stakeholder. This includes manually verifying automated log analysis tools. 
c) 
Logs shall be held locally and be periodically mirrored on a centralized server to prevent 
system-level tampering of the data. 
d) 
All network devices shall leverage Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers to standardize 
time stamps for log data to ensure a proper timeline can be recreated in the event of an 
incident. 
 
3.12.2 Clock Synchronization. To facilitate logging, the clocks of all relevant information 
processing systems within an organization or security domain shall be synchronized with an 
agreed upon and accurate time source. 
 
3.13 Remote Access 
 
3.13.1 General Statement. Remote access is defined as any access to the system outside of the 
‘trusted’ network.  Remote access, where permitted, shall authenticate all computer systems

based on the authorized settings of the network or firewall application that establishes a 
connection with the network.  The security of remote access will be reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis, in conjunction with the current technology and approval from the network operator / 
stakeholder. 
 
3.13.2 Remote Access Requirements. If supported, a network may utilize password-controlled 
remote access as long as the following requirements are met:  
 
a) 
A remote access user activity log shall be maintained as described below;    
b) 
No unauthorized remote user administration functionality shall be permitted (adding 
users, changing permissions, etc.); 
c) 
No unauthorized access to a database other than information retrieval using existing 
functions shall be allowed;  
d) 
A network filter (firewall) shall be installed to protect access. 
 
NOTE: GLI acknowledges that the system manufacturer may, as needed, remotely access the 
network and its associated components for the purpose of product and user support, if permitted. 
 
3.13.3 Remote Access Log Auditing. The network server must maintain an activity log either 
automatically or have the ability to manually enter the logs depicting all remote access 
information.  Remote access logs shall minimally include the following: 
 
a) 
Log-on name of the user; 
b) 
Time and date the connection was made; 
c) 
Duration of connection; and  
d) 
Activity while logged in, including the specific areas accessed and changes that were 
made.

CHAPTER 4 
4.0 WIRELESS NETWORKS 
 
4.1 
Industry Standards 
 
4.1.1 Industry Standards for Wireless Networks. The majority of wireless standards in use 
today evolved from the work of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). This 
body develops standards for a wide range of technologies including wireless.  The IEEE 
developed the first wireless LAN standard, 802.11, back in 1997.  Multiple iterations of this 
basic wireless standard have been promulgated since that time. 
 
4.2 
Unique Considerations 
 
4.2.1 General Statement. The wireless interface defines the communication boundary between 
two entities, such as a piece of software, a hardware device, or the end-user. It may also provide 
a means of translation between entities, which do not speak the same language.  This section 
deals with software interfaces which exist between separate hardware and software components 
that compose the wireless system, and which provide a programmatic mechanism such that these 
components can communicate. 
 
4.2.2 Communication Protocol. Each component of a wireless network shall function as 
indicated by the communication protocol implemented.  All communication between the 
server(s) and the mobile client shall use appropriate authentication and cryptographic protocols 
to provide mutual authentication of the mobile device and the server, ensuring the integrity of the 
data communicated, and for confidentiality, encrypting the data communicated. GLI strongly 
recommends the use of commercially available 802.1(x) protocol-compliant devices in 
conjunction with other applicable security conscience components.  Any alternative

implementations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with network operators / stakeholders 
approval. 
 
4.2.3 Wireless Server Used with Other Systems.  In the event the wireless server is utilized in 
conjunction with other systems; (i.e. On-Line Monitoring and Control Systems, Ticket 
Validation Systems, Progressive Systems, etc.) including remote access, all communications 
shall pass through at least one approved application-level firewall, and must not have a facility 
that allows for an alternate network path unless the alternate route conforms to the requirements 
of this document, and has independent security (i.e. the keys are not the same as other networks). 
One choice for network authentication is IEEE 802.1X. As an open standard with support for 
multiple authentication protocols, 802.1X is flexible enough to support everything from digital 
certificates to username/password authentication, and platforms from low-end PDA devices and 
mobile phones up to desktop and server operating systems.  
 
NOTE: Each wireless network reviewed by the independent test lab will be examined thoroughly 
to ensure that the proposed field configuration is secure.  The independent test lab may provide 
additional security recommendations and provide on-site training to the network operator / 
stakeholder, if requested.  
 
4.2.4 Wireless Network Physical Security.  A wireless network shall conform to the following 
minimum requirements: 
 
a) 
Wireless Access Points (WAPs) shall be physically located such that they are not easily 
accessible to the general public; 
b) 
If the above is not fesasible, all exposed Ethernet outlets shall be disabled to reduce the 
risk of network intrusion; 
c) 
The wireless network should preferably be designed to be an independent (isolated) 
network in accordance with multiple layering techniques discussed earlier;

d) 
The network shall support monitoring for evidence of unauthorized entry.  If entry has 
been detected, the network shall assert appropriate controls to lock down or disable the 
suspected entry point, if possible, and notify the network operator / stakeholder; and 
e) 
The network shall retain evidence of any physical tampering of hardware components. 
 
4.2.5 Wireless Network Software Security. A wireless network shall: 
 
a) 
Be designed or programmed in such a way that it may only communicate with authorized 
wireless clients/devices.  Software transferred between server and client/device must be 
implemented using a method that securely links the client/device to the server, such that 
the software may only be used by authorized clients/devices. In general, if certificates, 
keys, or seeds are used they must not be hard coded, and must change automatically, over 
time, as a function of the communication link.  Each method shall be reviewed by the 
network operators / stakeholders and the independent test lab on a case-by-case basis; 
b) 
Employ encryption and strong user authentication, with a recommendation of at least two 
methods of validation prior to opening a wireless session; Acceptable methods include : 
Username and password, a physical token, smart ID card, etc.; 
c) 
Perform mutual authentication to ensure that clients only communicate with valid 
networks. One example of this type of authentication is the use of a digital certificate. 
Upon joining the network, the client/device is presented with a server-side digital 
certificate. If the client/device trusts the certificate, the authentication process continues. 
If the certificate is not trusted, the process terminates; 
d) 
Validate clients/devices at pre-defined time intervals with at least one method of 
authentication as described above.  This time interval shall be configurable based on 
network operators / stakeholders requirements; 
e) 
Maintain a list (database) of authorized clients/devices, which it can communicate with. 
This list shall include the client/device name, a unique client/device ID and the 
corresponding hardware identifier (MAC);   GLI recommends implementing MAC 
(Media Access Control) filtering to delay unauthorized users from gaining access to the 
wireless network;

f) 
Install and maintain a stand-alone stateful (i.e., based upon a state table) packet 
inspection firewall, which shall isolate the access points from other network components 
that the casino has deployed; 
g) 
Obfuscate the Service Set Identifier (SSID) so that what networks it is connected to are 
not immediately apparent. Hiding the SSID only delays discovery.;  
h) 
Close active sessions if user authentication has exceeded the number of failed attempts; 
the number of failed attempts shall be configurable based on network operators / 
stakeholders requirements; 
i) 
Provide a printable report of failed network access attempts, including the time and date 
stamp, the device name, and the hardware identifier of all devices requesting access to the 
network; and 
j) 
GLI recommends the use of strong user authentication, authorization and encryption, 
which will validate the user against a secure database.  Communications between the 
network and the client device shall use protocols designed for securing, authenticating 
and encrypting wireless networks.  One example of the appropriate protocol is IEEE 
802.1x. It provides the framework required and permits the use of higher-level 
authentication methods such as those methods listed in the table below.

4.2.6 Component Failures. The wireless network shall have sufficient redundancy and 
modularity to accommodate a component failure to prevent the interruption of the wireless 
operations.  In addition, there shall be redundant copies of each audit log and system database, 
where applicable, on the wireless server with open support for backups and restoration.  This 
includes a wireless network that has support for failover redundancy.  A backup scheme 
implementation must occur in compliance with the Disaster Recovery Policy, although all 
methods will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the independent test lab. 
 
4.2.7 Recovery Requirements. In the event of a catastrophic failure when the wireless network 
cannot be restarted in any other way, it shall be possible to reload the system from the last viable 
backup point and fully recover the contents of that backup, recommended to consist of at least 
the following minimum information, as applicable: 
 
a) 
Significant events;

b) 
Auditing information; and 
c) 
Specific site information such as unique configuration settings, security accounts, etc. 
 
4.2.8 Wireless Protocols and Communications. Where appropriate, the IEEE 802.11x standard 
shall be used with standard wireless networks: IEEE 802.11x (Wireless Local Area Network 
(WLAN)), IEEE 802.15 (Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)), and IEEE 802.16 
(Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN)).  
 
a) 
WLAN security is addressed in the transmission layer with the IEEE 802.11i draft 
standard and at the IP applications layer with standards and policy-based authentication 
and access control.  
i. 
The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) algorithm, which is part of the 802.11 
standard, should be considered compromised and unreliable;  
ii. 
The WiFi Protected Access (WPA2) standard and Protected Extensible 
Authentication Protocol (PEAP) with the IEEE 802.1x Network Port 
Authentication standard provides improved security. 
iii. 
WPA2 allows for automatically generated per-user, per-session keys through 
802.1x. In addition, keys can be regenerated (re-keying) periodically to increase 
security. 
iv. 
Pre-Shared Key (WPA-PSK) is susceptible to “brute force attacks” (attacks 
predicated upon repetition). If it is used, strong passphrase use is also required.  
GLI recommends the use of a randomly generated passphrase longer than 16 
characters containing all of the following: 
• 
Uppercase  
• 
Lowercase 
• 
Digits 0-9 
• 
Symbols. 
v. 
Maintaining a secure wireless network is an ongoing process that requires greater 
effort than that required for other networks and systems.  Therefore, it is 
important that the network operators / stakeholders assess risks more frequently

and test and evaluate system security controls when wireless technologies are 
deployed. 
b) 
WLAN Wireless Access Point Device Security 
i. 
The Service Set Identifier (SSID) shall be changed from the factory default setting 
and limit their identifying information. 
ii. 
The broadcast SSID feature can be disabled, requiring wireless clients/devices to 
be pre-configured for a specific access point, and causing delays for unauthorized 
users. 
iii. 
Management access passwords must be changed from their default setting and the 
cryptographic keys shall be changed from the factory default setting. 
Cryptographic keys shall be changed often.  
iv. 
Access point devices shall be managed via network management tools using 
SNMPv3 or higher. If network management is not performed by the network 
operators / stakeholders, SNMP shall be disabled. 
v. 
Access point devices that operate with a central controller are recommended and 
shall be disabled during off-hours, or when not in use. 
vi. 
Access points that are connected to the Internet by any means must have their 
traffic use a Virtual LAN (VLAN)  and/or Network Address Translation (NAT) .  
VLANs are covered by IEEE 802.1Q.  The use of VPN shall be employed when 
accessing internal resources.  
vii. 
Signal strength (signal-to-noise ratio) of Wireless Access Points shall be audited 
and reduced to encompass only desired areas. 
viii. 
A list of authorized Wireless Access Points shall be maintained by the network 
operator. The network operator shall regularly scan for unauthorized access points 
broadcasting inside its defined network perimeter. These rogue access points can 
serve as an unprotected entry point into the network. 
ix. 
A list of authorized Wireless Access Points shall be maintained by the network 
operator / stakeholder. The network operators / stakeholders shall regularly scan 
for unauthorized access points broadcasting inside its defined network perimeter.

These rogue access points can serve as an unprotected entry point into the 
network. 
c) 
Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) devices used for network access, internal 
network-based Internet access, and application software shall: 
i. 
Be required to adhere to the same range of security requirements as WLAN client 
devices. 
ii. 
Require PIN entry or other authentication. 
iii. 
Invoke link encryption on all connections and broadcast transmissions. 
iv. 
Be set to the lowest necessary sufficient power level as to keep transmission 
localized to the immediate area. 
v. 
Require strong device passwords as to prevent the unauthorized use of said 
devices. 
vi. 
Use application-level encryption, VPN technologies, and authentication. 
vii. 
Be turned off when not in use. 
d) 
Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) connectivity used to interconnect 
buildings shall use VPN technologies and transmissions shall be encrypted. 
e) 
Firewall technology shall be implemented at all wireless application gateways. This is an 
additional level of security that will reduce unauthorized access to operational networks.

5.1 
General Statement 
 
5.1.1 General Statement.  Social engineering attacks include non-technical intrusions into a 
network using information acquired through human interaction and rely on tricks that prey on an 
individual being unfamiliar with emerging technology and protocols.  The network operators / 
stakeholders should establish policies and implement the necessary training programs to care for 
these sorts of attacks. 
 
5.2 
Vendor Impersonations 
 
a) 
Attackers place calls to internal employees impersonating hardware, software, or service 
vendors attempting to gather information pertaining to internal systems. Valuable 
information could include passwords or network device models. 
b) 
Employees should be educated as to what could be considered sensitive information and 
to whom inquiries of this type should be directed to within the network operators / 
stakeholders. 
 
5.3 
Publicly Available Information 
 
a) 
A review of publicly available information regarding operational networks shall be 
completed routinely. When possible, this type of information should be kept from public

CHAPTER 6 
6.0 CLOUD COMPUTING RESOURCES 
 
6.1 
General Statement 
 
6.1.1 
This document will use the definition of cloud computing as published in NIST Special 
Publication 800-145: 
"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared 
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) 
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider 
interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four 
deployment models." 
Additionally the terms Consumer(s), Client(s), and Provider(s) will follow the definitions from the same 
source. 
 
6.2 
General Considerations 
 
6.2.1 Introduction.  To varying extents, moving to a cloud solution from a more conventional 
client-server model results in a potential shift in the control of the operating environment. In 
most cases, this is intentional and considered to be part of the goal of outsourcing.  The 
utilization of cloud computing resources can provide for increased computing resource 
availability enhanced monitoring of operations and enhanced back-up and recovery functions. 
While direct physical control of network resources is outsourced in a cloud computing 
environment, the use of discreetly located secure data centers latently provide a similar level of 
physical security than local data centers; albeit, in a slightly different way. in virtual cloud 
environments, security can be further enhanced by the ability to “roll” or transfer data easily to 
other data centers in the case of impending natural disasters or other potential failure scenarios.

While the use of cloud computing resources can appear to offset at least some level of physical 
control it also potentially provides for enhanced overall security of the data by allowing the 
ability to be more agile with respect to overall monitoring, back-up, recovery and general system 
health activity. 
 
6.2.2 Verification of authenticity. The identity of all parties cannot be taken at face value. An 
identity verification mechanism such as certificates must be employed and verified. 
 
6.2.3 Service agreements: As portions of what would be local infrastructure are handled by a 
third party, the service level agreement should detail be detailed and able to comply with the 
established local Security Policy. 
 
6.2.4 Physical Security. The Cloud provider must prove that their physical security is certified 
to a verifiable and auditable standard (e.g. ISO27001). 
 
6.2.5 On-site Private Clouds. On-site private clouds are cloud environments which are wholly 
located on the consumer's premises. 
 
6.2.6 On-site Private Cloud Security. Security of the on-site private cloud is effectively the 
same as the recommendations set forth in the preceding sections of this document. 
 
6.2.7 Off-site Private Cloud. An Offsite private cloud may be secured in the same way as an 
on-site private cloud. No assumptions may be made about the level of protection given by the 
provider. 
 
6.2.8 Public Cloud.  In a public cloud, as the ability to build a tunnel may not exist, all traffic 
to and from your application could be considered un-trusted sensitive data and will have to be 
encrypted by the application.
